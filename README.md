# RSKaster: Hackathon Submission

## Project Overview

RSKaster is a groundbreaking client that leverages Farcaster's social graph to facilitate the onboarding of new community members into the Rootstock ecosystem. Through transactional infeed Frames, we guide users through the process of adding the Rootstock chain to their MetaMask, bridging ETH to rBTC, and minting their first Rootstock NFT.

## Problem Statement

Onboarding and community building within the Rootstock ecosystem pose significant challenges. The process of integrating users into Rootstock is often cumbersome and complex, which can deter potential community members.

## Solution & Grand Vision

Our solution is to integrate Rootstock into the Farcaster ecosystem by creating a dedicated Rootstock channel that offers easy onboarding through infeed Frames. The first Frame includes functionalities for swapping from Base ETH to rBTC and minting the first Rootstock NFT.

## Key Features

- **Rootstock Onboarding Frame:** Simplifies the process of adding Rootstock chain to MetaMask.
- **ETH to rBTC Bridge:** Users can easily bridge ETH to rBTC using Symbiosis Finance.
- **NFT Minting:** Users can mint their first Rootstock NFT through a streamlined process.

## Technical Implementation

- **Rootstock RPC with API Key:** Utilized for querying Rootstock blockchain data.
- **Rootstock Blockchain:** Deployed and verified NFT contract.
- **Explorer.rootstock.io:** Used to verify the NFT contract.
- **Symbiosis Finance:** Facilitates the bridging of ETH to rBTC.

## Demo

A brief walkthrough of the channel showcases the Frame and its features, including executing a swap and minting an NFT. This demonstration highlights the simplicity and efficiency of our onboarding process.

## Future Roadmap

We plan to continue developing additional Frames that integrate into the Rootstock channel. Our goal is to create resources that allow other Rootstock projects to gain exposure to an audience of over 400,000 users. We aim to incentivize the sharing of unique transaction hashes and gamify the onboarding experience to further engage the community.

## Usage of Rootstock

- **Rootstock Farcaster Frame:** Utilized for onboarding through transactional Frames.
- **Rootstock NFT Contract:** Deployed and verified on the Rootstock blockchain.
- **Rootstock Bridging:** Enabled through the integration with Symbiosis Finance.

## Conclusion

RSKaster represents the first Bitcoin client to leverage Farcaster's social graph for community building and onboarding via transactional infeed Frames. By integrating Rootstock into the Farcaster ecosystem, we aim to simplify the onboarding process and foster a thriving community within the Rootstock network.
